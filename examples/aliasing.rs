/*! Memory region aliasing.

This test demonstrates how `bitvec` handles creation of slices that do not alias
individual *bits* in memory, but do alias the *elements* that contain those
bits. Because the hardware executing the `bitvec` instructions operates at the
element level, `bitvec` is forbidden from introducing conditions that cause
element-wide modifications to interfere with each other.

# How It Works

The `&mut BitSlice` reference is capable of analyzing its address value to
determine if it is possible for another reference handle to view the elements it
touches. It is undefined behavior to even *read* a memory element that is being
simultaneously written, *even if the bits subject to change will be erased*.

Fortunately, the Rust `&`/`&mut` reference exclusion rules already forbid the
possibility of a read reference viewing as unaliased the same element that a
write reference is modifying.

`BitSlice` only has a small number of methods that are capable of introducing an
alias, and they are all ultimately descended from `.split_at_mut()` and
`.split_at_mut_unchecked()`. Methods such as `.get_mut()` are *not* aliasing,
because Rust’s lifetime rules prevent the reference to the rest of the slice
from being used while the narrower reference handle is alive!

The methods that introduce parallel, disjoint, handles to memory that may alias
are all marked in the type system as producing handles to aliased memory. These
handles will either use atomic `lock` instructions to synchronize access across
threads, or use `Cell` access and remove their ability to cross thread
boundaries. Both mechanisms prevent race conditions from occurring.

# What This Test Does

This test demonstrates the effects in the type system of performing aliasing
work, and how users may remove the over-conservative alias taint on a slice. The
alias marker is added for *all* elements in a slice domain, after all, but only
the elements on the edges are actually aliased! This test demonstrates using
`.split_at_mut()` to taint slice handles, and `.bit_domain_mut()` to narrow the
taint to only the affected addresses.
